My public dotfiles.  I symlink most of these from my home directory on every
machine I use regularly.

The INSTALL script seems to work, but is obtuse and scary.  I can argue to
myself that there are legitimate reasons, at least enough to let me sleep at
night, but I won't hold it against you if you disagree.

Commit messages here are extremely terse, as it is mostly used only by me.

I would be curious to hear if anyone uses snippets from here.  Drop me a line.
