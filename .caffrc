Hi,

Please find attached the user id{(scalar @uids >= 2 ? 's' : '')}:

{foreach $uid (@uids) {
    $OUT .= "\t".$uid."\n";
};}
of your key {$key}, signed by me.  You can import the signature by
running it through "gpg --import".

Note that I did not upload your key to any keyservers, or save a copy of your
signed key on my local keyring.  If you are able to retrieve and decrypt this
encrypted message, it indicates that the email address you presented to me
on your key is valid.  Once you have imported my signature into your keyring,
please re-export your key, and send it back to me.  You'll probably also want
to make this new signature available to others, perhaps by uploading it to a
keyserver with "gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --send-key {$key}".

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Thanks,
-mct
EOM
